# BLE Simulator

This BLE emulator is a library which simulates mobile OS Bluetooth Low Energy behavior by mocking mobile OS BLE interface.

# Goal of Project

The goal of this project is to fully simulate mobile OS BLE interaction in application layer with minimum application code change.

# Challenge During Mobile BLE Development
 * Hard to run automatic test with synchronized BLE peripheral hardware
 * Hard to trigger end cases and timing condition
 * Mocked code presents unfaithful logic
 * Hard to test background/idle mode
 * Can not Step by Step debugging
 * software development has to wait till firmware & hardware is developed
